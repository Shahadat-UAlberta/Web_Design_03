<h1> Covid-19 update</h1>
<p> The COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh is part of the worldwide <i>pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</i> caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was confirmed to have spread to Bangladesh in March 2020. The first three known cases were reported on 8 March 2020 by the country's epidemiology institute, IEDCR. Since then, the pandemic has spread day by day over the whole nation and the number of affected people has been increasing.

In order to protect the population, the government declared "<u>lockdown</u>" throughout the nation from 23 March to 30 May and prepared some necessary steps to spread awareness to keep this syndrome away from them.<sup>[3]</sup> Infections remained low until the end of March but saw a steep rise in April.<sup>[4]</sup> In the week ending on 11 April, new cases in Bangladesh grew by 1,155 percent, the highest in Asia, ahead of Indonesia, with 186 percent.<sup>[5]</sup> On 6 May, cases were confirmed in all districts. Rangamati was the last district to report confirmed cases of COVID-19. On 13 June, the number of cases in Bangladesh exceeded the number of cases in China, the country where the outbreak began. Bangladesh reached two grim milestones of 160,000 cases and 2,000 deaths on 5 July and overtook France in terms of the number of cases two days later. The number of recoveries in the country exceeded the number of active cases on 12 July.

Bangladesh is the third most affected country in South Asia, after India and Pakistan.<sup>[6]</sup></p>  
<h5>Bangladesh confirms 810K cases since 2020. </h5>				
<h2> <b> What is vaccination? </b></h2> 
<details><summary>Defination</summary><p>A COVID 19 vaccine is a <strong>biotechnology</strong> product intended to provide acquired immunity against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19). As of August 2020, there were 231 vaccine candidates in development,<sup>[1]</sup><sup>[2]</sup> although no candidate has completed clinical trials to prove its safety and efficacy. In August, at least 26 vaccine candidates were in clinical trials, with six beginning Phase III and 20 still in Phase I–II.<sup>[1]</sup><sup>[2]</sup><sup>[3]</sup> 
Previous work to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus diseases SARS and MERS established considerable knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses – which accelerated rapid development during early 2020 of varied technology platforms for a COVID 19 vaccine.<sup>[4]</sup>
<mark>The World Health Organization (WHO)</mark>, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the Gates Foundation are committing money and organizational resources for the prospect that several vaccines will be needed to prevent continuing COVID 19 infection.<sup>[5]</sup> The CEPI, which is organizing a US$2 billion worldwide fund for rapid investment and development of vaccine candidates,<sup>[6]</sup>indicated in April that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than twelve months or by early 2021.<sup>[7]</sup> On 4 May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon which received US$8.1 billion in pledges from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID 19 infections.<sup>[8]</sup> At the same time, the WHO also announced the deployment of an international "Solidarity trial" for simultaneous evaluation of several vaccine candidates reaching Phase II–III clinical trials.<sup>[9]</sup>
